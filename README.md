# Create a "Whac-a-Block" game in Minecraft

Minecraft is a popular sandbox open world-building game. A free version of Minecraft is available for the Raspberry Pi; it also comes with a programming interface. This means you can write commands and scripts in Python code to build things in the game automatically. It's a great way to learn Python!  

If you have already completed ["Getting Started With Minecraft Pi"](http://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/getting-started-with-minecraft-pi/) and want to do more, how about creating your own game in Minecraft, a "game in a game"?

The game you are going to create is called "Whac-a-Block", inspired by the original arcade game "Whac-a-Mole". The objective of the game is to whack (or hit with a sword) the blocks that light up as glowstone, and turn them back to stone.
